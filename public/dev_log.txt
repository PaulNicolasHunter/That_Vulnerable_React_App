Adam - hey Matt ! seems like the manager needs an "admin" panel.

Matt - What for lol XD 

Adam - They said it'll be useful to leave notes to the dev about the website.

Matt - Seems legit.

Adam - Hey I've made a "AdMiN" panel that we were talking about. XD, also added a cool little feature to change the usernames.

Matt - neat, where's it at?

Adam - ehh? I wanted to make it less obvious, so named it /appControlRoom_01
